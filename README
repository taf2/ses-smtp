SMTP Interface to Amazon SES


Amazon's SES is very nice and affordable.  It would be even nicer if it could be used through existing SMTP clients


ses-smtp acts as a simple proxy translating SMTP to amazon ses HTTP


== Config Usage

host 'localhost'
port 40998

server "email.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
access_key "amazon-access-key"
secret_key "amazon-secret-key"
domain "example.com"

# attach hooks to perform custom actions before and after emails are sent
before_send do|email|
  puts "sending email to #{email.recipient.inspect}"
end

after_send do|email, status|
  puts "email sent with status: #{status}"
end

== TODO
  - should be able to pass much more of the email direct to amazon using the send raw API
  - commandline interface
